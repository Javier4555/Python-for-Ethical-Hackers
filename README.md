# Python for Ethical Hackers

Welcome to the **Python for Ethical Hackers** course! This comprehensive course is designed to provide you basic concept of Python programming and great start to create your own tools for ethical hacking and cybersecurity tasks.

## Course Overview

In this course, you will learn:

- The fundamentals of Python programming language.
- How to leverage Python for ethical hacking and cybersecurity purposes.
- Hands-on experience in creating your own Python scripts for various tasks.
- Essential concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, and more.
- **Challenge 1:** FizzBuzz Challenge - A classic programming challenge to reinforce your skills.
- **Challenge 2:** Hangman Challenge - A text-based game project to apply your learning.
- Developing a Spider Tool for web crawling and data extraction.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (no prior Python experience required).
- Familiarity with ethical hacking and cybersecurity basics is a plus but not mandatory.

3. **Explore the Challenges**: Inside the directory, you'll find the challenges and project.
    
4. **Work on Projects**: Work through the course material, complete the challenges, and develop your Spider Tool following the provided instructions.

## Challenges and Projects

### Challenge 1: FizzBuzz Challenge

The FizzBuzz challenge is a great way to practice basic programming logic. It involves printing numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, you print "Fizz," for multiples of 5, you print "Buzz," and for multiples of both 3 and 5, you print "FizzBuzz."

### Challenge 2: Hangman Challenge

The Hangman challenge is a text-based game where you guess a secret word letter by letter. Develop your own version of the Hangman game and practice handling strings and user input.

### Spider Tool Project

In this project, you'll develop a Spider Tool that crawls websites, extracts data, and presents it in a structured format. This tool can be a valuable asset for data collection in ethical hacking scenarios.
