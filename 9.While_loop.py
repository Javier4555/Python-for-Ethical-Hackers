# Hello everyone! , we are learning how to implement a 'while loop' in python.

# while loops execute statements while the condition is true. As soon as the condition becomes False.

# simple example of while loop :-

# i = 0
# while (i<3):
#    print(i)
#    i = i+1

# another example :-

count = 5
while(count > 0):
    print(count)
    count = count - 1
